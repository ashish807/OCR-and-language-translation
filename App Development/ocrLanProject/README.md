We are building this Android App so that peoples can use our project in day to day basis. 

Till now, we have implemented object detection part and we are working on the OCR and language translation part. 

For now you can run this app in android platform and enjoy detecting the 80 different objects.

This app is very user friendly, anyone can easily use this app and get benefited.

For the Object Detection we converted the pre-trained model of mobilenet into the lite version which can be integrated into flutter. Access model [here](https://github.com/ashish807/OCR-and-language-translation/tree/master/App%20Development/app_dev/assets/tflite)

We are planning to train our own model and run that trained model in backend, but for now we don't have any access to GPU so we cannot train our own model, as soon as we get access we will train our own model, until then we are using this lite version
